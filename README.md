# elmAppTemplate
This simple app provides a structured layout to begin new projects using the Elm Architecture. 

**Features:**

 - A welcome message and button
 - Retrieves the current date/time 
 - Creates a Seed to generate random numbers. 

**File organization**

The Elm Architecture's App, View, Update and Model components each exist in its own file. I based this on [Kris Jenkins'](https://github.com/krisajenkins) blog post [How I Structure Elm Apps](http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/04/how-i-structure-elm-apps.html), with two file name changes. (*State.elm and Types.elm became Update.elm and Model.elm*).
